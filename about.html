                <h2>What is the goal of the project?</h2>
                <p>The goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of the memetic discourse around the 2022
                    Russian-Ukrainian War and creating a classification system to identify memetic trends. This project
                    focuses
                    mainly on English-language memes from a few large producers of memes, which reveals just one area of
                    the
                    memetic landscape, but one can expect that these are the memes that the average American or
                    English-speaking meme enthusiast
                    might come across. Memes from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit offer a very different take
                    on the war than
                    editorial, government, or academic actors, as memers feel more licensed to poke at the extreme,
                    obscene, and absurd.
                    Memes do not offer a more "true" or valid look at the situation than a conventional source, but they
                    often offer an
                    unconstrained perspective which traditional media lack. Memes, as a part of folklore, serve a number
                    of purposes from entertainment
                    to education to emotional relief. We can only guess at the intentions behind these memes, but we can
                    infer their meaning through their
                    content and context. The majority of memes here invoke sympathy and support towards the Ukrainian
                    cause, testament to
                    the fact that the Western world is largely against the war. Perusal of the Russian-speaking web
                    likely paints
                    a very different picture of the conflict. Therefore, the project is a window into the thoughts,
                    feelings, and
                    whimsies of English-language memers during the first 70 days of the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian war. The
                    memes present
                    criticsm, commentary, humor, and foolishness in varying amounts. I do not condone
                    the messages or images in the memes, and in fact, many of them are disturbing given the humanitarian
                    catastrophe
                    of the war. My heart goes out to everyone affected by the war, and I hope this project draws more
                    attention
                    towards the absurdity and suffering of war and the importance of devoting resources towards ending
                    this war.

                <h2>Where are the memes from?</h2>
                <p>The memes are collected from four social media sites: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit.</p>
                <h3>Twitter</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href="https://twitter.com/ukraine/" target="_blank">@Ukraine</a></b>: The official Twitter
                        account of Ukraine. This account is obviously pro-Ukraine and is
                        particularly interesting because of its official status on Twitter. Although this account is
                        more formal than accounts
                        like <a href='https://twitter.com/menaconflicted/' target="_blank">@MENAConflicted</a>, it is
                        less formal than an official Russian government twitter like
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/mfa_russia" target="_blank">@mfa_russia</a> (the Russian Ministry
                        of Defense Twitter)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href='https://twitter.com/menaconflicted/' target="_blank">@MENAConflicted</a></b>: Also
                        known as "Ukraine Memes for NATO Teens",
                        this Twitter account has almost 40 thousand followers. It is unclear who runs this account, but
                        they were the top result on
                        Twitter for "memes about the Russia-Ukraine war". The account posts multiple times a day:
                        usually humorous memes but also
                        military updates and footage. This account would be an example of an 'informal' memetic actor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href='https://twitter.com/USEmbassyKyiv' target='_blank'>@USEmbassyKyiv</a></b>: I have
                        only included one tweet
                        from @USEmbassyKyiv (the one comparing Kyiv and Moscow over time). This meme seemed to evoke
                        @Ukraine's tone,
                        but it is not typical for the @USEmbassyKyiv Twitter account, which mostly posts news updates.
                        It is interesting that
                        @Ukraine is making use of memes while other government Twitters largely stay away from them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Facebook</h3>
                <p>I collected memes from a few popular and slightly less popular Ukraine-Russia Facebook meme groups,
                    including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/349633820405331/media' target="_blank">Memes if

                </ul>
                <h3>Instagram</h3>
                <p>A search on Instagram for "ukraine russia memes" provided the following accounts which I used for
                    collection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href='https://www.instagram.com/ukrainian_meme_force/'
                                target="_blank">@ukrainian_meme_force</a></b> (3k followers)</li>
                    <li><b><a href='https://www.instagram.com/ukrainearmedmemes/' target="">@ukrainearmedmemes</a></b>
                        (2.5k followers)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reddit</h3>
                <p>
                    All Reddit memes are from <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/'
                        target='_blank'><b>r/memes</b></a>, a subreddit
                    with 18.7 million members.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2>About the collection process</h2>
                <h3>How did I choose the particular memes?</h3>
                <p>
                    I chose mainly English-language memes from popular social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook,
                    Instagram, and Reddit. This project is a first look at the meme space, so I wanted to search
                    several sites and cover a "representative" sample of English-language memes, since each source
                    has its own audience and pecularities. To narrow my search, I excluded generic gifs, images and
                    memes that have been repurposed in the war context because I am not interested in general meme
                    use and commentary during wartime but rather new memes which have incorporated text and images
                    specific to the Russia-Ukraine war. I have attempted to collect memes from after February 24th, 2022
                    for relevancy. Choosing English-language memes from February 2022 - May 2022 paints a picture of
                    the memetic landscape at a certain point in time for a particular audience. When there was an abundance
                    of memes to choose from, I chose memes with the most upvotes, retweets, likes, comments, or shares. 
                    I was also particularly interested in memes which offered narratives or criticism that ran against 
                    mainstream discussions of the war.
                </p>
                <h3>What methods did I use to collect the memes?</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Twitter</b>: I scraped Twitter with <a href='https://www.tweepy.org/' target="_blank">Tweepy</a>,
                    a Python library to access
                    the Twitter API. <a href='https://github.com/eelegiap/warmemes/blob/main/otherFiles/tweepy.ipynb'
                        target='_blank'>Code is here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Facebook, Instagram, Reddit</b>: I collected memes from Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit manually
                    by searching for
                    keywords relating to the Russia-Ukraine war and saving images as I went.
                </p>
                <h3>Why didn't I include timestamps or links back to the original posts?</h3>
                <p>
                    Collecting this much information is outside the scope of my current project, which aims to provide
                    a classification on the general meme landscape of the Russia-Ukraine 2022 war in the 
                    English-language social media sphere. In my case, I felt like the original post was not 
                    critically important because I saw the same meme posted in several places. Future projects 
                    could gather timestamps or links back to the original posts to investigate the timeline of meme evolution,
                    public responses to memes, and more specific questions of audience and interaction.
